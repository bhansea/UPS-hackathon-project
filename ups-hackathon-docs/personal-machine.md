# Personal Machine - cloning your git repository

Please use command prompt when using Git, other terminals such as `Git Bash` have had some issues connecting in the past. To clone the repository:

```
git config --global http.proxyAuthMethod 'basic'
```

then, in a folder of your choice run:

```
git clone `<your team's github repo url>`
```

A sample can be seen below:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/UPS-2023-Hackathon/team-0-sample.git 
```
